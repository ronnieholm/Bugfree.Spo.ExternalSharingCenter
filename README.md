With SharePoint Online, getting a tenant-wide overview of which site
collections are shared with which external users (anyone with a
Microsoft account) is hard. Without such overview, and governance in
place for managing external users, one risks inadvertently sharing
information with too many for too long.

The External Sharing Center (from here on ESC) adds a layer of
management and governance on top of the out of the box features. It
does so by providing the overview and support for creating and
maintaining sharings with metadta such as start and end date. As the
end date nears, ESC reminds the inviter that a sharing is about to
expire and provides the option to extend it. Once expired, ESC revokes
user access from the site collection and sends an access revocation
mail to the inviter.

ESC consists of a frontend and a backend part (to keep the design
simple, the design doesn't include any custom web service):

  - A frontend SharePoint web to be installed into any site
    collection. The web holds pages to display an overview of sharings
    by site collection and for easy adding and editing of sharing
    using a guided approach (see end-user documentation).

  - A background job which monitors site collections and sends out
    expiration warnings and revocation mails and revokes user
    access. The job can be setup to continuously import new users and
    sharings. Otherwise, it threats sharings not already in ESC as
    unknown and revokes those. Which approach to use depends on
    whether sharings recorded in ESC or site collections are
    considered master.

Other notable features of ESC include:

  - Aggregated expiration warning and access revocation mails grouped
    by inviter to minimize number of mails sent. Each mail contains a
    table of sharings and provides a link to ESC for editing.
  
  - Overview with security trimmed list of site collections or only
    site collections with sharing enabled, or a combination of both.

## Compiling

The repository is self-contained and may be compiled by opening the
solution in Visual Studio 2015. Compiling triggers NuGet package
restore and transpiles the TypeScript which powers the frontend.

## Installing

### Backend

The CLI is used to partially setup the frontend, to import existing
sharings, to expire user access, and to generate and send mails. The
WebJob serves a similar role running in Azure, but only generates mail
and expires user access (both share a common core).

Before running the CLI (or WebJob), AppSettings inside
Bugfree.Spo.ExternalSharingCenter.Cli/App.config must be defined as
per below description. Running the CLI in different modes is
accomplished by editing Program.cs file:

  - **ExternalSharingCenterUrl**. Running CLI in setup mode assumes
    the hosting web exists and is based on an English (1033) team site
    template. CLI sets up pages, lists, quick launch, and so forth. In
    regular mode, CLI processes users and sharings stored in lists on
    the web.

  - **TenantAdministratorUsername**, **TenantAdministratorPassword**.
    Iterating site collections and their external users requires
    tenant-level access using this account and password.

  - **ExpirationWarningDays**. When a sharing expires in this number
    of days, the backend sends a warning mail to the inviter or one in
    the Owners groups of a site collection in case the inviter cannot
    be located.

  - **ExpirationWarningMailsMinimumDaysBetween**. To avoid repeatedly
    sending expiration mails whenever the backend runs, this value
    indicates the minimum number of days between sending warning mails
    for external users in a single site collection.

  - **MailFrom**. Mail is sent using SharePoint's Utility.SendEmail
    routine, i.e., no SMTP server setup is required. SendEmail
    requires a site collection context and thus only supports mailing
    users in a specific site collection. The from address must be a
    valid mail address as verified by SharePoint Online.

For the WebJob, additional connection strings are required. These are
standard WebJob settings and as such unrelated to ESC:

  - **AzureWebJobsDashboard**, **AzureWebJobsStorage**. The WebJob API
    stores logs and other runtime information inside an Azure Storage
    Account. Ideally, the account would be named after the WebJob, but
    the name must be between 3 and 24 lower-case characters and Azure
    globally unique. *bugfreespoextsharingcntr* is used inside the
    config files, but constructing a real name including the tenant is
    better.

    The connection string is available under *Storage Account*,
    *Keys*, and then *Primary Connection String*. As with any config
    file connection string, Azure ignores it for security reasons and
    requires those be setup in the Azure Portal under *Application
    Settings*.

On first-time publication of Bugfree.Spo.ExternalSharingCenter.WebJob
from inside Visual Studio, a schedule must be setup. Running the
WebJob on a recurring schedule at 1am, every night is a sensible
default given that user access expires at midnight.

### Frontend

A few manual setup steps are required to finalize ESC setup:

  1. On Start.aspx and
     Site%20collection%20external%20user%20guide.aspx within
     SitePages, put the page in edit mode and edit the properties of
     the Loader web part. Under *Appearance*, change *Chrome Type*
     from *Default* to *None* and exit page editing.

  2. Within SiteAssets, delete the existing Notebook file.
  
  3. Within SiteAssets, create a folder named App and upload the
     following files from Bugfree.Spo.ExternalSharingCenter.Core/App
     to it:

        Apps.js
        Loader.js
        Loader.html
        SiteCollectionExternalUserGuide.html
        SiteCollectionExternalUsersOverview.html

Depending on the web's security settings, Contributor access may need
to be granted to users creating and editing sharings (JavaScript runs
on the user's behalf). Specifically, *External users* and *Site
collection external users* lists must be editable.

## Limitations

Only sharing an entire site collection by authenticated users is
supported by ESC. Sharing at a finer level of granularity, such as
list or list item, makes gaining an overview even trickier and thus
isn't supported. If these finer-grained sharing options become
relevant, consider creating a dedicated sharing site collection
besides the regular ones.

## Design notes

Within ESC, we try hard not to replicate build-in SharePoint dialogs
for external sharing. Since we cannot easily hook into SharePoint's
invite logic, instead we provide import logic for either one-time or
continuous synchronization of SharePoint actual with ESC. In either
case, users and sharings are added to ESC with configurable default
values, such as some number of days until the sharing expires.

SharePoint Online provides an API (through the
[ShareObject](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vesku/2015/10/02/external-sharing-api-for-sharepoint-and-onedrive-for-business)
class in CSOM and similar in REST) by which invitations can be
programmatically created. In principle, it would be possible for ESC's
JavaScript to call this REST API on the user's behalf. This would
relieve the user from having to create a matching sharing in both the
site collection and ESC.

Given the time it takes for the backend to iterate site collections
and their sharing, the frontend can't provide up-to-date sharing
information except for what it already stores. The ESC frontend
therefore doesn't show display name of user, invited as, invited by,
and when the sharing is created. Such information would have to be
stored inside ESC (in a list or property bag entry) and maintained by
the backend.

The frontend's overview page, listing site collections, was originally
solely SharePoint search driven. In SharePoint Online, search is the
only way for client-side code to list site collections. Unfortunately,
search cannot filter on site collections with sharing enabled, causing
it to display any site collection which the user has access to. As an
alternative, the backend maintains a list of site collection with
sharing enabled which the frontend can be switched to display
instead. By combining the two, the frontend displays only site
collections the user has access to and which have sharing enabled.

An important consideration is whether to treat the InvitedAs or the
AcceptedAs property of an external user as the truth. From a technical
point of view both may be equally valid as long as the choice is
consistent across frontend and backend. Trouble arises when the invite
goes to one address and the user accepts from another. Then if ESC is
retroactively introduced, every mismatch sharing is considered
unauthorized and is revoked. The first deployment of ESC happened
retroactively and about 150 of 370 sharings, or 40%, didn't match
up. Forcing inviters to re-share and users to accept from the right
address might be a lot of work. Therefore, the backend may be
configured so that sharings involving an external user added before a
certain date are ignored.
